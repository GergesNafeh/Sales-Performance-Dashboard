For this project, I applied the full data analysis process:
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Analytics:
‚Ä¢	Analyzed historical data to display key financial metrics like total sales, costs, and net profit, highlighting sales patterns by product, category, and geography.
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnostic Analytics:
‚Ä¢	Investigated the root causes of issues, such as low sales in specific markets (e.g., Denmark) and underperforming products like SanDisk. I used RFM segmentation to identify valuable and at-risk customers.
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Analytics:
‚Ä¢	Used predictive modeling to forecast 2025 sales, identifying potential declines and emphasizing the need for proactive strategies to sustain growth.
